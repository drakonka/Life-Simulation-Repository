It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system, and was introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson in a paper published in 1983 to illustrate the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\nNote that there are several recreations of the Daisyworld simulation available online. \r\n\r\n**Other Links**\r\n* [Daisyworld wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisyworld)\r\n* [Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld](http://www.tellusb.net/index.php/tellusb/article/view/14616)\r\n* [Spatial Daisyworld model](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/nania/nania-projects-Daisy.html)\r\n* [James Lovelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock)\r\n* [Andrew Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Watson_(scientist))\r\n* [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis)\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n## Grandroids \r\n### [http://grandroids.com/](http://grandroids.com/)\r\n\"virtual creatures constructed from complex networks of virtual brain cells and biochemical reactions and genes\"\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Steve Grand, creator of Creatures.\r\n\r\n**Other Links**\r\n* [Grandroids FAQ](https://stevegrand.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/grandroids-faq/)\r\n* [Progress diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDKL-2vihuaRLHjsZCxtr6qj0oCe8lV82inwmCVrjBs/pub)\r\n* [Steve Grand (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Grand_(roboticist))\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Human Brain Project - Simulation Platform\r\n### [https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/brain-simulation-platform1](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/brain-simulation-platform1)\r\n\r\n\"The Brain Simulation Platform will use parallelised versions of the well-established Neuron, STEPS and NEST simulators and will exploit simulation workflows and tools developed by EPFL's Blue Brain Project.\"\r\n\r\n**Other Links**\r\n* [Human Brain Project wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Brain_Project)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## OpenWorm\r\n### [http://www.openworm.org/](http://www.openworm.org/)\r\n\"OpenWorm is an open source project dedicated to creating a virtual C. elegans nematode in a computer.\"","google":"UA-65044735-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
